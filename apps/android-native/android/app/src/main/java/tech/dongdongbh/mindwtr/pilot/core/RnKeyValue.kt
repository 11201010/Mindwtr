/**
 * RN's key-value store, in place: AsyncStorage's `databases/RKStorage`, table `catalystLocalStorage`, with RN's key names and
 * text values (plan D1). An upgraded RN user keeps every device key (the sync configuration, the encryption state, ...), and an
 * RN recovery build reads what this app wrote.
 *
 * Each call opens the file, runs AsyncStorage's own statements in one transaction with `synchronous = FULL`, and closes it: a
 * write is on disk before the call returns. Engine thread only (LegacyRnStoreGuard.commitRnState, the other opener, runs there
 * too); no other process writes the file (a package replace kills the RN app).
 *
 * A file this class creates gets RN's schema and `user_version = 1`, as RN's SQLiteOpenHelper (ReactDatabaseSupplier, version 1)
 * leaves it. At version 0 RN would run its onCreate over the existing table, fail, and delete the whole database on its retry.
