/**
 * The write-ahead journal under the app's `files/journal`: every write request (a [WRITES] method and its exact arguments,
 * its request UUID included) is on disk before the engine sees it, and leaves only after core's final reply. After process
 * death or a stopped engine, the next boot replays what is left, in order (CoreHost.replayJournal); core's crash-safe
 * commands make a replay write nothing wrong. Engine thread only.
 *
 * An entry is one file, `<sequence>.json`: written whole to a temporary file, synced, renamed into place, and the directory
 * synced. A temporary file left by a death mid-write was never sent, so it is removed. An entry that cannot be read, or names
 * a method that is not a write, is moved to [ASIDE], never replayed and never deleted. A journal that cannot be listed refuses
 * to open (the boot fails as a failed load does, so no write runs), and an entry never takes the name of a file on disk.
 * [floor] is the highest sequence recorded outside the journal (DeviceWrites): a new entry is numbered above it too, so the
 * numbering never goes back after the journal empties.
