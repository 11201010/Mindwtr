/**
 * Native: RN's CaptureSyncHeadlessService woke React Native's JS to import the pending-captures queue (#1257). Here the app's
 * CoreWork stores the queue, through the hook the app sets at process start ([install], MindwtrApplication). RN's dialog
 * (QuickCaptureActivity, compiled as it is) calls [start] where it started RN's service. Everything else RN's writer queues (the
 * capture intent receiver's item, a widget check-off RN's CheckoffStore sweeps into the queue), RN's files compiled as they
 * are, is seen here: the hook also runs when an item is published in the queue folder. A missing or failing hook loses nothing:
 * the file stays queued, and the next app start drains it.
