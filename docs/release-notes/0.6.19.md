# Mindwtr 0.6.19

## Highlights
- Strengthened sync correctness across core, desktop, and mobile, including attachment-state persistence, earlier timestamp normalization, and stricter merged settings sanitization.
- Improved mobile experience with better sync cadence behavior, safer widget data handling, Copilot loading feedback, and smoother quick-add flow.
- Improved desktop task/attachment UX with stale-load guards, blob URL lifecycle cleanup, accessibility error announcements, and filtering feedback.
- Hardened cloud and MCP surfaces with stricter validation, bounded rate-limiting, and pagination improvements.

## Sync / Core
- Fixed desktop sync dropping attachment mutation metadata after attachment processing.
- Moved timestamp normalization before merge conflict resolution to avoid inconsistent winners.
- Added merged-settings sanitization safeguards to avoid malformed remote settings corrupting local state.
- Aligned task visibility behavior between helper filtering and query paths.
- Added additional sync race coverage (delete-vs-update, rapid add/delete interleaving, cloud merge edge cases).

## Desktop
- Fixed attachment audio loading race conditions and cleaned up blob URLs on unmount.
- Added screen-reader friendly attachment error announcements.
- Added filtering/loading indicator in large filtered list views.
- Reduced task row rerender overhead by stabilizing/memoizing key callbacks and props.

## Mobile
- Fixed stale closure behavior in sync cadence handling.
- Improved quick add by dismissing keyboard after submit.
- Added Copilot "thinking" loading state.
- Hardened Android widget payload building and sync-config value validation.
- Improved iOS sync edge cases (version/path handling) and widget/theme behavior.

## Cloud / MCP / CI
- Hardened cloud API security and resilience: stricter token/path handling, pagination, and bounded rate-limit key growth.
- Added cloud merge tests for delete/update race behavior.
- Tightened MCP tool input schemas and made preflight migration failures explicit.
- Enabled TestFlight external tester notifications in iOS/macOS App Store workflows.
