# Mindwtr 0.7.0

## Highlights
- Fixed a sync edge case where stale attachment references could block remote sync.
- Improved attachment validation and unrecoverable handling to avoid repeated failing retries.
- Refined delete-vs-edit conflict handling so genuinely newer edits are preserved while ties remain deterministic.
- Hardened CI and release workflows with stronger validation and safer automation defaults.

## Mobile
- Sync reliability improved for attachment-heavy task/project data.
- Android FOSS release pipeline now enforces strict APK selection and stronger artifact checks.
- Kept FOSS permission policy explicit: unused camera/alert/storage permissions removed, `RECORD_AUDIO` retained for voice notes.

## Desktop
- Sync attachment validation integration is now consistent in TypeScript builds.
- Desktop lint/type checks are now enforced more consistently in CI.

## Sync & Cloud
- Fixed attachment-state handling that could trigger pre-remote-sync reference errors.
- Improved conflict resolution behavior for near-simultaneous delete/update operations.
- Added additional guardrails in cloud/release pipelines to reduce bad-release risk.

## Build & Release
- Release workflows now include stricter artifact integrity checks and required release notes.
- Android and iOS release pipelines include improved cache/reliability settings.
- Wiki sync and Docker image metadata automation were modernized and hardened.
